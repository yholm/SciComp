using SciComp.LinearAlgebra;
using SciComp.Numerics;

var A = new Matrix( 
[
    new([1, 4]), // [ 1, 2, 3 ]
    new([2, 5]), // [ 4, 5, 6 ]
    new([3, 6])
]);
var B = new Matrix(
[
    new([7, 9, 11]),  // [ 7, 8 ]
    new([8, 10, 12]), // [ 9, 10]
]);                   // [11, 12]

var C = A * B;
